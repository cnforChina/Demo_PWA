\subsection resinp Resonance Parameter Input File

The resonance input file, ususally called res.inp could look like this:
\code
# res.inp
# Example configuration file for resonances

f0  = 2.15 0.0486    1        # comment
f2  = 2.0010 0.133   1        # comment
f4  = 2.0010 0.133   1        # by wangjk
\endcode
As you can see, comments are started with a #. The description of a 
resonance begins wih a resonance name; after the = sign follow the
resonance mass, width and type, wherby type is currently not used.


\subsection parainp Fit Parameter Input File

The parameter input file, usually called para.inp, might look like this:
\code
# para.inp
# Example configuration file for parameters 
bg_mag = 10.0 -50 0 500

f0_mag = 2.26 2 0 500
f0_phase = 1.11 0.3 -3.14159 3.14159

f20_mag = 1 2 0 500
f20_phase = 1.0 -0.3 -3.14159 3.14159

f21_mag = 0.03 2 0 500
f21_phase = 1.0 -0.3 -3.14159 3.14159

f22_mag = 0.2 2 0 500
f22_phase = 1.0 -0.3 -3.14159 3.14159
\endcode
Again, comments are started with a #. A fit paramater is introduced by its name,
followed by the = sign and then
- the initial value of the paramater,
- the initial error of the parameter (used as a stepsize by certain minimizers); if the initial error is negative, GPUPWA will fix the corresponding fit parameter,
- the lower limit for the parameter. If this value is set to 999, no lower limit is set,
- the upper limit for the parameter. If this value is set to 999, no upper limit is set.

\subsection filefile File Input File

In a future version, GPUPWA will read file names and related information from a file.inp input file.

\section outputfiles Output Files

For every sucessful fit, GPUPWA creates a fitresult_<Analysisname>_<fitnumber>.txt file, whose contents
should be self explanatory and encompass the used wave set, input and output parameters and some fit statistics.
If a series of fits is run, a multifitresult_<Analysisname>_<fitnumber of first fit>.txt file is created,
listing the minimum likelihoods in each fit.

GPUPlotset can produce root and postscript files with plots.

If GPUPWA is compiled with the -pg option, a gmon.out file will be generated for each run, which can be used for
profiling with the gprof program.

\section internalfiles Files used by GPUPWA for its own Happyness

GPUPWA will also generate an \<Analysisname\>_Amplitude_MC_Integral with coefficients for the MC integral. 
If you do not intend to fiddle with resonance parameters, the coefficients do not have to be recalculated
for each program run and can be read from tha file.
There is also an \<Analysisname\>.cnt file, which is used to sequentially number program runs and fits. If you
wish to reset those counters, just delete this file.
